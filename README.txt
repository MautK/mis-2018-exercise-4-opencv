For the calculation of the position and the size of the red circle we are using theories about the golden ratio.

According to this the width of the nose is one fifth of that of the face.
Because the face detection is not 100% accurate we improved this number with experimenting.
That is how we ended up with making the circle as big as 1/7th of the face.

Restrictions of the app are:
we are just implementing the frontal face detection so there is unfortunately no red nose day for people that are observed from the side.
Red nose day is only functioning in landscape view and with a certain orientation.
